# Introduction
Welcome to the TestOfFire! We are the world's first *test* oriented coding platform. We help seasoned engineers practice testing techniques and help young job-seekers learn tactics for future job interviews.

# Inspiration

# How it works
Log on to our platform and pick a problem to start with.
Think about the algorithm and any potential test cases.
Start writing your test cases in Python as simple instance methods ex. def test_this(self): ...
Submit your test cases when you're ready.
Receive detailed feedback about whether your test cases are wrong, incomplete, or pass our platform!
Track your progress on your dashboard.
Your code is persisted to *Firebase* in realtime, so you'll never lose your progress!

# In the future
- Adding hundreds of problems (content)
- System-oriented sandboxing with Docker (dev)
- Support for multiple languages (dev)
- Moving data to Postgres (dev)
